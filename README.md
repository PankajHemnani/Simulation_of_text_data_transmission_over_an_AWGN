# Simulation of text data transmission over an AWGN
## GOAL
To write a python code on an encoding-decoding technique for text data so that the received signal can be detected correctly after addition of unwanted noise during its transmission.
## COMPONENTS OF CODE
There are 7 major component in our code which are
1. Signal Encoding 
2. Channel Encoding
3. Modulator
4. Adding of Noise (Additive White Guassian Noise)
5. Demodulator
6. Channel Decoding
7. Signal Decoding
