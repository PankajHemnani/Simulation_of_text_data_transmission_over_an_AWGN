# Simulation of text data transmission over an AWGN
## GOAL
To write a python code on an encoding-decoding technique for text data so that the received signal can be detected correctly after addition of unwanted noise during its transmission.
## COMPONENTS OF CODE
There are 7 major component in our code which are
1. Signal Encoding 
2. Channel Encoding
3. Modulator
4. Adding of Noise (Additive White Guassian Noise)
5. Demodulator
6. Channel Decoding
7. Signal Decoding

## Prerequisites Packages

```
python3 pip install numpy
```
## GUIDE TO USE THE CODE
1. To Pass your Text pass through **TextToBeEncoded** 
2. You can change the Standard Deviation in CHANNEL NOISE i.e in AWGN (More the Standard Deviation more will be the Errors while Decoding)
## OUTPUT
You will get your text parsed and Your output Depends on the Standard Dviation.
